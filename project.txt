Git is a version control system that intelligently tracks changes in files. Git is particularly useful when you and a group of people are all making changes to the same files at the same time.

Typically, to do this in a Git-based workflow, you would:

Create a branch off from the main copy of files that you (and your collaborators) are working on.
Make edits to the files independently and safely on your own personal branch.
Let Git intelligently merge your specific changes back into the main copy of files, so that your changes don't impact other people's updates.
Let Git keep track of your and other people's changes, so you all stay working on the most up-to-date version of the project.
